To Do list for the practice.go app

The plan is to create a programm that i can run quickly in the terminal to reference programming topics in go. This will be very helpful when i code more complex topics and I would need to refer to a topic.

- find out how I can rather divide all of the projects into standalone packages, and then reference them in the practice.go package. 
- thus i would need to run them, but also i would like to display the whole package, so that the user can see the source code with the results.

To display source code from other Go packages in the terminal from your `main` package (`practice.go`), you need to **read the `.go` files as plain text** using Go's file reading functions.

Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

### 1. Example Project Structure

```
/myproject
  |-- main.go
  |-- utils/
        |-- helper.go
```

### 2. `helper.go` (other package)

```go
package utils

import "fmt"

func SayHello() {
    fmt.Println("Hello from utils!")
}
```

### 3. `main.go`

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "io/ioutil"
    "log"
)

func main() {
    data, err := ioutil.ReadFile("utils/helper.go")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    fmt.Println(string(data))
}
```

### Output

When you run `go run main.go`, it will print the source code of `utils/helper.go` in the terminal.

Let me know if you want to filter only functions or specific parts of the file.
