To Do list for the practice.go app

The plan is to create a programm that i can run quickly in the terminal to reference programming topics in go. This will be very helpful when i code more complex topics and I would need to refer to a topic.

- find out how I can rather divide all of the projects into standalone packages, and then reference them in the practice.go package. 
- thus i would need to run them, but also i would like to display the whole package, so that the user can see the source code with the results.

- also, use flags and commang line sub arguments to be able to quickly call and reference a place, instead of going visually through the list.
